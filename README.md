# Song-Recommendation-Engine
Developed a song recommendation engine using Neo4J and a dataset of 114,000 Spotify songs. Modeled songs as graph nodes with properties like acousticness and energy, connecting similar songs via Euclidean distance. The project includes data preprocessing, graph database modeling, and Cypher queries for personalized music recommendations.
